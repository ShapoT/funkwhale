## Development environment

### Pre-commit

The [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) tool is used to ensure that the files you commit are properly formatted, follow best practice, and don't contain syntax or spelling errors.

You can install and setup pre-commit using the [quick-start guide on the pre-commit documentation](https://pre-commit.com/#quick-start). Make sure to [install pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#1-install-pre-commit) and [setup the git pre-commit hook](https://pre-commit.com/#3-install-the-git-hook-scripts) so pre-commit runs before you commit any changes to the repository.
